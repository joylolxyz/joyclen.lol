        <h1><strong>apology</strong></h1>
        <p>as some of you know, me and nolan have been <strong>broken up</strong>. over the past few days, we've been broken up, i've realized my time comes to an <strong>end</strong> on this platform. i realize that i have nothing to do anymore. i did everything for nolan and wanted to stay with him forever, but sadly due to personal issues, that will never happen. i tried apologizing so much to him, but it didn't work, and i'm blocked everywhere. i now realize that i hurt a lot of people with my time alone, and i would like to apologize for it deeply. if i hurt you, i'm sorry, and i hope you can accept my apology. i will be going from everyone now, as nobody needs me now, and i realize i'm going to be an outcast to everyone if i ever meant something.</p>
        <br>
        <p>as an apology to nolan, i want to apologize for everything i've done to you. you know what i've done, and it's very bad. i cannot change the past, and i know i can't, but i hope you don't have any emotions off me now i'm gone. i understand you have already tried to get rid of me, and i respect that. but thank you for the chance of dating you.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>my time here is come to an end, i've realized nobody needs me anymore and i think the only way of getting rid of the guilt and my emotions over mine and nolans breakup is to just disappear, and act like i never existed. i've always self-harmed but this week has been the worst week. im not making this a guilt-tripping apology, but i want you all to know what happens to me. thank you for all the people who listened to me, and wanted to care about me.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>im sorry, thank you for everything.</strong></p>
